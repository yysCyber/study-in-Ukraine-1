| Other Instructions | I can design a simple Web application now, but I know a good Web application is very complex, for example the application should support PC and Mobile at the same time, the application can achieve high concurrency, when we design application, we can use Middleware to help us make the application better. I think I should do better. |

| Item               | Content                                                      |

| Other Instructions | Because  *ARM* course in  Second Year and *MCU* course in Third Year, I think *MCU* course should in Second Year and *ARM* course should in Third Year. When I studied *ARM*, I felt very difficult. |



## 3. Study Plan

- Study theory of computer science and engineering more comprehensively and carefully.

> Although I have studied some courses during my undergraduate, for example *Data Structure*, *Network and its Computing*, etc. I also have some knowledge that I can't understand.
>
> I hope my teachers can help me review some knowledge and teach me some new knowledge.

- Develop some good Web applications or Mobile applications based on teachers' requirement or my personal idea or others.

> I spent a lot of time on Web programming during my undergraduate, but my applications are very simple, just only do some operations about CURD. 
>
> Current Web applications are very complex. They use some Front-Frame like *Vue*, *React*, *Angular* etc. They use a lot of Middleware to help us make applications better like *Redis*, *Queue*, etc.
>
> One of my final target is becoming a Software Architect.

- Study basic knowledge about hardware, hardware programming, IoT.

> I hardly ever got knowledge or practiced about hardware during my undergraduate. It is very difficult to tell you what I want to learn. Maybe combine hardware and software, IoT.

- Big Data and AI

> Maybe use some technology about Big Data and AI to help you analyse data that get from your software and hardware applications. Make applications more clever.

- Practice as more as possible.

> As for me, I need to pay more attention to practice. I believe if you practice successfully, your papers are not very difficult to finish.



---

 

- Database, Operation System

> Maybe it is a big challenge for everyone if you want to optimize based on open source, but it is honor for me. Of course, if I can't achieve during the master, maybe do someting during PhD.

- PhD

> It is also my dream.

- Others

> Maybe I have made some mistakes in my study plan because the plan is just only my personal opinion.
>
> No matter what, I will keep hardworing.
